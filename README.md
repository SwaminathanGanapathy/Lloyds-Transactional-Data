# ðŸ“Š Lloyds Transactional Data â€” Analysis & Modeling

Exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and predictive modeling on anonymized Lloyds Bank transaction data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project analyzes large volumes of bank transaction records to:
- Understand customer spending patterns and behaviors.
- Segment customers for targeted marketing and risk analysis.
- Build simple predictive models for spending trends.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (K-Means, Linear & Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Data Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks
- **Other:** Data stored in CSV, S3 (now sanitized)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Work Done
- Cleaned & transformed raw bank transaction CSVs (dates, amounts, categories).
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** â€” frequency trends, seasonal spend patterns, top merchants.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers by spending behavior.
- Built regression & classification models (Linear, Logistic, Random Forest) for trend prediction.
- Visualized KPIs: inflow/outflow trends, category spend, customer clusters.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results & Insights
- Identified distinct customer segments (e.g., high-spend vs. low-frequency users).  
- Seasonal salary/spending cycles visible across clusters.  
- Simple models showed potential for predicting transaction volumes & customer churn risk.
